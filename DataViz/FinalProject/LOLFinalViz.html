   <h1>League Of Legends Ban Data</h1>
   <p>Visualization By: Jimmy Rosser, Jacob Rivera, Martin Gordon, Lizzie Ruetschle<p></p>
   <p>This is a visualization of champion data from League of Legends. <br> It displays the number of times a champion was banned in a large set of matches. <br> The user can filter the dataset by lane to see which champions are most commonly used in that lane and which are banned the most.</p>
   <p>Choose a selection from the drop down menu to filter the dataset of champions by lane.</p>
   <label for="lanes">Choose a Lane:</label>
    <select name="lanes" id="lanes" onchange="selectionChanged()">
      <option value="All">All</option>
      <option value="TOP">Top</option>
      <option value="JUNGLE">Jungle</option>
      <option value="MID">Mid</option>
      <option value="BOT">Bottom</option>

		<p>About Our Project:</p>
    <p>The data set we used was created by Paolo Campanelli on Kaggle. It was data pulled from 180,000 League of Legends ranked matches from 2014 to 2016.<br>
        Interesting Finds: We noticed a correlation between the number of times a champion is played and the number of times they are banned.<br>
        Interesting Data Issue: We went through multiple datasets before finding the one used in the above visualization. Many of these datasets were too large to load in a reasonable amount of time.<br>
        Improvements: Adding a meningful color gradient and more information to to the tooltip would allow the user to interpret and explore the data easier.</p>
